Each instance of the API class has\n\t * a \"context\" - i.e. the tables that it will operate on. This could be a single\n\t * table, all tables on a page or a sub-set thereof.\n\t *\n\t * Additionally the API is designed to allow you to easily work with the data in\n\t * the tables, retrieving and manipulating it as required. This is done by\n\t * presenting the API class as an array like interface. The contents of the\n\t * array depend upon the actions requested by each method (for example\n\t * `rows().nodes()` will return an array of nodes, while `rows().data()` will\n\t * return an array of objects or arrays depending upon your table's\n\t * configuration). The API object has a number of array like methods (`push`,\n\t * `pop`, `reverse` etc) as well as additional helper methods (`each`, `pluck`,\n\t * `unique` etc) to assist your working with the data held in a table.\n\t *\n\t * Most methods (those which return an Api instance) are chainable, which means\n\t * the return from a method call also has all of the methods available that the\n\t * top level object had.

The function takes a single parameter, an object of\n\t\t *   parameters with the values that DataTables has readied for sending.

This is the\n\t\t *   default that DataTables uses (incrementally increased for each column).\n\t\t * * `string` - read an object property from the data source. There are\n\t\t *   three 'special' options that can be used in the string to alter how\n\t\t *   DataTables reads the data from the source object:\n\t\t *    * `.` - Dotted Javascript notation. Just as you use a `.` in\n\t\t *      Javascript to read from nested objects, so to can the options\n\t\t *      specified in `data`. For example: `browser.version` or\n\t\t *      `browser.name`. If your object parameter name contains a period, use\n\t\t *      `\\\\` to escape it - i.e. `first\\\\.name`.\n\t\t *    * `[]` - Array notation. DataTables can automatically combine data\n\t\t *      from and array source, joining the data with the characters provided\n\t\t *      between the two brackets. For example: `name[, ]` would provide a\n\t\t *      comma-space separated list from the source array. If no characters\n\t\t *      are provided between the brackets, the original array source is\n\t\t *      returned.\n\t\t *    * `()` - Function notation. Adding `()` to the end of a parameter will\n\t\t *      execute a function of the name given. For example: `browser()` for a\n\t\t *      simple function on the data source, `browser.version()` for a\n\t\t *      function in a nested property or even `browser().version` to get an\n\t\t *      object property if the function called returns an object. Note that\n\t\t *      function notation is recommended for use in `render` rather than\n\t\t *      `data` as it is much simpler to use as a renderer.\n\t\t * * `null` - use the original data source for the row rather than plucking\n\t\t *   data directly from it. This action has effects on two other\n\t\t *   initialisation options:\n\t\t *    * `defaultContent` - When null is given as the `data` option and\n\t\t *      `defaultContent` is specified for the column, the value defined by\n\t\t *      `defaultContent` will be used for the cell.\n\t\t *    * `render` - When null is used for the `data` option and the `render`\n\t\t *      option is specified for the column, the whole data source for the\n\t\t *      row is used for the renderer.\n\t\t * * `function` - the function given will be executed whenever DataTables\n\t\t *   needs to set or get the data for a cell in the column. The function\n\t\t *   takes three parameters:\n\t\t *    * Parameters:\n\t\t *      * `{array|object}` The data source for the row\n\t\t *      * `{string}` The type call data requested - this will be 'set' when\n\t\t *        setting data or 'filter', 'display', 'type', 'sort' or undefined\n\t\t *        when gathering data. Note that when `undefined` is given for the\n\t\t *        type DataTables expects to get the raw data for the object back<\n\t\t *      * `{*}` Data to set when the second parameter is 'set'.\n\t\t *    * Return:\n\t\t *      * The return value from the function is not required when 'set' is\n\t\t *        the type of call, but otherwise the return is what will be used\n\t\t *        for the data requested.\n\t\t *\n\t\t * Note that `data` is a getter and setter option. If you just require\n\t\t * formatting of data for output, you will likely want to use `render` which\n\t\t * is simply a getter and thus simpler to use.\n\t\t *\n\t\t * Note that prior to DataTables 1.9.2 `data` was called `mDataProp`. The\n\t\t * name change reflects the flexibility of this property and is consistent\n\t\t * with the naming of mRender.

There are\n\t\t *   three 'special' options that can be used in the string to alter how\n\t\t *   DataTables reads the data from the source object:\n\t\t *    * `.` - Dotted Javascript notation.

If your object parameter name contains a period, use\n\t\t *      `\\\\` to escape it - i.e. `first\\\\.name`.\n\t\t *    * `[]` - Array notation. DataTables can automatically combine data\n\t\t *      from and array source, joining the data with the characters provided\n\t\t *      between the two brackets. For example: `name[, ]` would provide a\n\t\t *      comma-space separated list from the source array. If no characters\n\t\t *      are provided between the brackets, the original array source is\n\t\t *      returned.\n\t\t *    * `()` - Function notation. Adding `()` to the end of a parameter will\n\t\t *      execute a function of the name given. For example: `browser()` for a\n\t\t *      simple function on the data source, `browser.version()` for a\n\t\t *      function in a nested property or even `browser().version` to get an\n\t\t *      object property if the function called returns an object.\n\t\t * * `object` - use different data for the different data types requested by\n\t\t *   DataTables ('filter', 'display', 'type' or 'sort').

There are also two modes of operation\n * for this child row display:\n *\n * * Inline - when the control element that the user can use to show / hide\n *   child rows is displayed inside the first column of the table.\n * * Column - where a whole column is dedicated to be the show / hide control.\n *\n * Initialisation of Responsive is performed by:\n *\n * * Adding the class `responsive` or `dt-responsive` to the table.

It provides the following\nfeatures, with an overview of how they are implemented:\n\n## Selection of rows, columns and cells. Whether an item is selected or not is\n   stored in:\n\n* rows: a `_select_selected` property which contains a boolean value of the\n  DataTables' `aoData` object for each row\n* columns: a `_select_selected` property which contains a boolean value of the\n  DataTables' `aoColumns` object for each column\n* cells: a `_selected_cells` property which contains an array of boolean values\n  of the `aoData` object for each row. The array is the same length as the\n  columns array, with each element of it representing a cell.\n\nThis method of using boolean flags allows Select to operate when nodes have not\nbeen created for rows / cells (DataTables' defer rendering feature).\n\n## API methods\n\nA range of API methods are available for triggering selection and de-selection\nof rows. Methods are also available to configure the selection events that can\nbe triggered by an end user (such as which items are to be selected). To a large\nextent, these of API methods *is* Select. It is basically a collection of helper\nfunctions that can be used to select items in a DataTable.\n\nConfiguration of select is held in the object `_select` which is attached to the\nDataTables settings object on initialisation. Select being available on a table\nis not optional when Select is loaded, but its default is for selection only to\nbe available via the API - so the end user wouldn't be able to select rows\nwithout additional configuration.\n\nThe `_select` object contains the following properties:\n\n```\n{\n\titems:string     - Can be `rows`, `columns` or `cells`. Defines what item \n\t                   will be selected if the user is allowed to activate row\n\t                   selection using the mouse.\n\tstyle:string     - Can be `none`, `single`, `multi` or `os`. Defines the\n\t                   interaction style when selecting items\n\tblurable:boolean - If row selection can be cleared by clicking outside of\n\t                   the table\n\tinfo:boolean     - If the selection summary should be shown in the table\n\t                   information elements\n}\n```\n\nIn addition to the API methods, Select also extends the DataTables selector\noptions for rows, columns and cells adding a `selected` option to the selector\noptions object, allowing the developer to select only selected items or\nunselected items.\n\n## Mouse selection of items\n\nClicking on items can be used to select items. This is done by a simple event\nhandler that will select the items using the API methods.\n\n */\n\n\n/* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n * Local functions\n */\n\n/**\n * Add one or more cells to the selection when shift clicking in OS selection\n * style cell selection.\n *\n * Cell range is more complicated than row and column as we want to select\n * in the visible grid rather than by index in sequence.

Each instance of the API class has\n\t * a \"context\" - i.e. the tables that it will operate on. This could be a single\n\t * table, all tables on a page or a sub-set thereof.\n\t *\n\t * Additionally the API is designed to allow you to easily work with the data in\n\t * the tables, retrieving and manipulating it as required. This is done by\n\t * presenting the API class as an array like interface. The contents of the\n\t * array depend upon the actions requested by each method (for example\n\t * `rows().nodes()` will return an array of nodes, while `rows().data()` will\n\t * return an array of objects or arrays depending upon your table's\n\t * configuration). The API object has a number of array like methods (`push`,\n\t * `pop`, `reverse` etc) as well as additional helper methods (`each`, `pluck`,\n\t * `unique` etc) to assist your working with the data held in a table.\n\t *\n\t * Most methods (those which return an Api instance) are chainable, which means\n\t * the return from a method call also has all of the methods available that the\n\t * top level object had.

The function takes a single parameter, an object of\n\t\t *   parameters with the values that DataTables has readied for sending.

This is the\n\t\t *   default that DataTables uses (incrementally increased for each column).\n\t\t * * `string` - read an object property from the data source. There are\n\t\t *   three 'special' options that can be used in the string to alter how\n\t\t *   DataTables reads the data from the source object:\n\t\t *    * `.` - Dotted Javascript notation. Just as you use a `.` in\n\t\t *      Javascript to read from nested objects, so to can the options\n\t\t *      specified in `data`. For example: `browser.version` or\n\t\t *      `browser.name`. If your object parameter name contains a period, use\n\t\t *      `\\\\` to escape it - i.e. `first\\\\.name`.\n\t\t *    * `[]` - Array notation. DataTables can automatically combine data\n\t\t *      from and array source, joining the data with the characters provided\n\t\t *      between the two brackets. For example: `name[, ]` would provide a\n\t\t *      comma-space separated list from the source array. If no characters\n\t\t *      are provided between the brackets, the original array source is\n\t\t *      returned.\n\t\t *    * `()` - Function notation. Adding `()` to the end of a parameter will\n\t\t *      execute a function of the name given. For example: `browser()` for a\n\t\t *      simple function on the data source, `browser.version()` for a\n\t\t *      function in a nested property or even `browser().version` to get an\n\t\t *      object property if the function called returns an object. Note that\n\t\t *      function notation is recommended for use in `render` rather than\n\t\t *      `data` as it is much simpler to use as a renderer.\n\t\t * * `null` - use the original data source for the row rather than plucking\n\t\t *   data directly from it. This action has effects on two other\n\t\t *   initialisation options:\n\t\t *    * `defaultContent` - When null is given as the `data` option and\n\t\t *      `defaultContent` is specified for the column, the value defined by\n\t\t *      `defaultContent` will be used for the cell.\n\t\t *    * `render` - When null is used for the `data` option and the `render`\n\t\t *      option is specified for the column, the whole data source for the\n\t\t *      row is used for the renderer.\n\t\t * * `function` - the function given will be executed whenever DataTables\n\t\t *   needs to set or get the data for a cell in the column. The function\n\t\t *   takes three parameters:\n\t\t *    * Parameters:\n\t\t *      * `{array|object}` The data source for the row\n\t\t *      * `{string}` The type call data requested - this will be 'set' when\n\t\t *        setting data or 'filter', 'display', 'type', 'sort' or undefined\n\t\t *        when gathering data. Note that when `undefined` is given for the\n\t\t *        type DataTables expects to get the raw data for the object back<\n\t\t *      * `{*}` Data to set when the second parameter is 'set'.\n\t\t *    * Return:\n\t\t *      * The return value from the function is not required when 'set' is\n\t\t *        the type of call, but otherwise the return is what will be used\n\t\t *        for the data requested.\n\t\t *\n\t\t * Note that `data` is a getter and setter option. If you just require\n\t\t * formatting of data for output, you will likely want to use `render` which\n\t\t * is simply a getter and thus simpler to use.\n\t\t *\n\t\t * Note that prior to DataTables 1.9.2 `data` was called `mDataProp`. The\n\t\t * name change reflects the flexibility of this property and is consistent\n\t\t * with the naming of mRender.

There are\n\t\t *   three 'special' options that can be used in the string to alter how\n\t\t *   DataTables reads the data from the source object:\n\t\t *    * `.` - Dotted Javascript notation.

If your object parameter name contains a period, use\n\t\t *      `\\\\` to escape it - i.e. `first\\\\.name`.\n\t\t *    * `[]` - Array notation. DataTables can automatically combine data\n\t\t *      from and array source, joining the data with the characters provided\n\t\t *      between the two brackets. For example: `name[, ]` would provide a\n\t\t *      comma-space separated list from the source array. If no characters\n\t\t *      are provided between the brackets, the original array source is\n\t\t *      returned.\n\t\t *    * `()` - Function notation. Adding `()` to the end of a parameter will\n\t\t *      execute a function of the name given. For example: `browser()` for a\n\t\t *      simple function on the data source, `browser.version()` for a\n\t\t *      function in a nested property or even `browser().version` to get an\n\t\t *      object property if the function called returns an object.\n\t\t * * `object` - use different data for the different data types requested by\n\t\t *   DataTables ('filter', 'display', 'type' or 'sort').

Columns removed from the right.\n *\n * In additional to column visibility control, Responsive also has built into\n * options to use DataTables' child row display to show / hide the information\n * from the table that has been hidden. There are also two modes of operation\n * for this child row display:\n *\n * * Inline - when the control element that the user can use to show / hide\n *   child rows is displayed inside the first column of the table.\n * * Column - where a whole column is dedicated to be the show / hide control.\n *\n * Initialisation of Responsive is performed by:\n *\n * * Adding the class `responsive` or `dt-responsive` to the table. In this case\n *   Responsive will automatically be initialised with the default configuration\n *   options when the DataTable is created.\n * * Using the `responsive` option in the DataTables configuration options.

It provides the following\nfeatures, with an overview of how they are implemented:\n\n## Selection of rows, columns and cells. Whether an item is selected or not is\n   stored in:\n\n* rows: a `_select_selected` property which contains a boolean value of the\n  DataTables' `aoData` object for each row\n* columns: a `_select_selected` property which contains a boolean value of the\n  DataTables' `aoColumns` object for each column\n* cells: a `_selected_cells` property which contains an array of boolean values\n  of the `aoData` object for each row. The array is the same length as the\n  columns array, with each element of it representing a cell.\n\nThis method of using boolean flags allows Select to operate when nodes have not\nbeen created for rows / cells (DataTables' defer rendering feature).\n\n## API methods\n\nA range of API methods are available for triggering selection and de-selection\nof rows. Methods are also available to configure the selection events that can\nbe triggered by an end user (such as which items are to be selected). To a large\nextent, these of API methods *is* Select. It is basically a collection of helper\nfunctions that can be used to select items in a DataTable.\n\nConfiguration of select is held in the object `_select` which is attached to the\nDataTables settings object on initialisation. Select being available on a table\nis not optional when Select is loaded, but its default is for selection only to\nbe available via the API - so the end user wouldn't be able to select rows\nwithout additional configuration.\n\nThe `_select` object contains the following properties:\n\n```\n{\n\titems:string     - Can be `rows`, `columns` or `cells`. Defines what item \n\t                   will be selected if the user is allowed to activate row\n\t                   selection using the mouse.\n\tstyle:string     - Can be `none`, `single`, `multi` or `os`. Defines the\n\t                   interaction style when selecting items\n\tblurable:boolean - If row selection can be cleared by clicking outside of\n\t                   the table\n\tinfo:boolean     - If the selection summary should be shown in the table\n\t                   information elements\n}\n```\n\nIn addition to the API methods, Select also extends the DataTables selector\noptions for rows, columns and cells adding a `selected` option to the selector\noptions object, allowing the developer to select only selected items or\nunselected items.\n\n## Mouse selection of items\n\nClicking on items can be used to select items. This is done by a simple event\nhandler that will select the items using the API methods.\n\n */\n\n\n/* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n * Local functions\n */\n\n/**\n * Add one or more cells to the selection when shift clicking in OS selection\n * style cell selection.\n *\n * Cell range is more complicated than row and column as we want to select\n * in the visible grid rather than by index in sequence.
